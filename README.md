This is my branch for the Earthquake Monitoring system. The logging_system_function files only work with MySQL (PHPMyAdmin) and requires an SQL script to generate the correct tables. This is local to your machine. The logging_SSMS_functional folder are the files required to run the website through the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. This is an external server so no setup is required. Simply copy the folder logging_SSMS_functional to the www folder in WAMP. Then do localhost/logging_SSMS_functional and website should work.
